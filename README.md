Our work demonstrates how intrinsically motivated behaviors can spontaneously arise
through an agent's continuous interaction with its environment and the development of sensory experience-driven priors.

* (a) Action occurs when the current situation differs from the self-prior.
* (b) The preferred prior is autonomously learned through experience (self-prior).
* (c) A reaching behavior toward a sticker emerges to minimize free energy.

Please refer to the environment-specific code for instructions on running the program.
